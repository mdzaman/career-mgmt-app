This is the microservices architecture for the reward system backend using Python, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway as specified in the requirements.



Here is a complete microservices-based backend for the reward system. Here's a breakdown of the architecture and components:

1. Microservices Architecture:
- XP Service:
  * Handles experience points management
  * Awards XP for activities
  * Tracks user XP totals

- Achievements Service:
  * Manages achievement unlocking
  * Tracks user achievements
  * Validates achievement requirements

- Levels Service:
  * Handles level progression
  * Checks level-up conditions
  * Awards level-up rewards

2. DynamoDB Tables:
- activities:
  * Stores activity definitions
  * Points values
  * Categories and descriptions

- achievements:
  * Achievement definitions
  * Requirements
  * XP rewards

- levels:
  * Level definitions
  * XP requirements
  * Level-specific rewards

- user_progress:
  * User progression data
  * Current level and XP
  * Unlocked achievements

3. API Endpoints:

XP Service:
```
POST /xp/award
- Awards XP for completed activities
- Updates user progress
- Triggers level-up checks
```

Achievements Service:
```
POST /achievements/unlock
- Unlocks new achievements
- Awards achievement XP
- Updates user progress
```

Levels Service:
```
POST /levels/check-level-up
- Checks level progression
- Handles level-up logic
- Awards level-up rewards
```

4. Key Features:

Data Management:
- Efficient NoSQL schema design
- Optimized for read/write patterns
- Scalable data structure

Error Handling:
- Comprehensive error checking
- Detailed error messages
- Transaction safety

Security:
- IAM role-based access
- API Gateway integration
- Secure data access

Scalability:
- Serverless architecture
- Pay-per-request billing
- Auto-scaling enabled

5. Implementation Details:

Common Components:
- Shared database manager
- Common data models
- Reusable utilities

Service Integration:
- Event-driven architecture
- Asynchronous operations
- Cross-service communication

Deployment:
- Serverless Framework configuration
- Infrastructure as Code
- Environment management

6. Usage Examples:

Award XP:
```python
# Award XP for completing an activity
response = await client.post("/xp/award", json={
    "user_id": "user123",
    "activity_id": "activity456"
})
```

Unlock Achievement:
```python
# Unlock a new achievement
response = await client.post("/achievements/unlock", json={
    "user_id": "user123",
    "achievement_id": "achievement789"
})
```

Check Level-up:
```python
# Check for level progression
response = await client.post("/levels/check-level-up", json={
    "user_id": "user123"
})
```

7. Deployment Instructions:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

3. Deploy using Serverless Framework:
```bash
serverless deploy --stage dev
```

8. Monitoring and Maintenance:

Logging:
- CloudWatch integration
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

Monitoring:
- API Gateway metrics
- Lambda execution stats
- DynamoDB throughput

Maintenance:
- Regular backups
- Performance optimization
- Security updates

This architecture provides a scalable, maintainable, and secure backend for the reward system. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect or add additional features?
